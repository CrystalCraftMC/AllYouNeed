All You Need
=============

We are the 2013 Duke TiP students at the University of Georgia taking the Team Programming for Video Games class during the first term of the program. Most of the students in the class began programming for the first time at the beginning of the term in June, and the program lasted three weeks. This specific Bukkit project is a group effort of some of the people from this class, including dobby1498, NightFog125, Hofstadler, Blastprocessor, and jflory7.
